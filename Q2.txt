Step 8: The private key is selected in 'json format', and downloaded.

Step 9: An EC2 instance is launched.

Step 11: The json file that was downloaded is uploaded to the EC2 instance.

Step 12: Enter the following commands:
       GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/etc/google/auth/application_default_credentials.json"
       sudo chown root:root "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"
       sudo chmod 0400 "$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS"

Step 13: Install Stackdriver monitoring and logging agents by entering following commands:
    curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-monitoring-agent.sh
    sudo bash install-monitoring-agent.sh
    curl -sSO https://dl.google.com/cloudagents/install-logging-agent.sh
    sudo bash install-logging-agent.sh --structured
    

Step 14: Go back to the Stackdriver Monitoring console.

Step 15: Create uptime check
